# 💼 Employee Salary Management Web Service

This project is a web service that is developed to help HR departments manage their employee information.
Each employee contains the following information:
| Information | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| id | `string` | unique alphanumeric ID assigned by the company. |
| login | `string` | unique alphanumeric login assigned by the company. |
| name | `string` | The name of the employee. |
| startDate | `LocalDate` | Employee start date. |
| salary | `double` | Employee salary.  |

The web service will be able to receive requests to create, update, read and delete employee information.
It will also have the ability to allow list of employees to be retrieved and sorted accordingly to the field type.
The service also supports an upload API which accepts a CSV file so that group Employee information can be updated/created at the same time.

## Key Assumptions and Decisions Made in building this project

#### Key Assumptions:
- Update API requires all employee fields to be present if not error is expected.
- Start date of any employee cannot be updated.
- First row is CSV is always ignored as they are for headers.

#### Design Decisions:
- Project is build using **Test Driven Development**(TDD) Where by test cases are written before the classes are created.
- Employee Service is decoupled from Upload Service so that controller can reuse services and services can reuse repository and they are not affecting each other.
- The decoupling also allow safety update service logic without affecting the other services
